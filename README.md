# ad-hoc-networks-ns3

Topics covered:


Computer networks basics


layers of the network, and which specs used in which layer


routing protocols, aodv,dsdv,olsr and setting up a static route


wireless sensor network-->ad hoc network


calculations of power, max transmission time, distance between nodes etc


NS3 proficiency kinda reqd: lots of example files used and tweaked a little here and there to produce results


if anyone wants to learn from scratch: run the files, watch youtube videos of pcap analysis of the network to build understanding. Tweak a few things in code and keep repeating.
