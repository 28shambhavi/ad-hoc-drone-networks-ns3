Likewise.......


The above analysis clearly shows that the static routing is working as per our desire.

Also we can see a significant reduction in delay (dt) from dt0 = 0.062461 to dt1 = 0.035461.
This is because after on packet tranfer (end-to-end), the path is explored (ie now there is no arp msgs).
